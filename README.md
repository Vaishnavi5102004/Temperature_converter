Temperature Converter Project
This is a temperature converter interface built using HTML and CSS. The project allows users to input a temperature value, select a conversion type (Celsius, Fahrenheit, or Kelvin), and view the converted result in a user-friendly design. The interface is simple, responsive, and visually appealing, demonstrating skills in structuring and styling interactive web elements without JavaScript. This project showcases proficiency in front-end development and creative design.
